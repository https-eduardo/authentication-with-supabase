# Simple Authentication with Supabase

A simple project that I made to learn more about developing applications using Supabase. It's just an implementation of a login system that you can create an user and then sign in.

### 👩‍💻 Technologies used

- Nest.js (backend)

First of all, you'll need to set up the enviroment.

Following the .env.example inside the each part of the system, implement .env file and insert the values of variables.

```bash
cd ./frontend
yarn install

# production
yarn build
